      <h1>Cactus & Succulent Care Tips</h1>
      <p id="intro">
        Cacti and succulents are easy care plants for any home or patio.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/post/cacti_succulents.svg" alt="" id="title_img" />
      <p class="text">
        Cacti and succulents are now a very common houseplant and caring for
        your cacti and succulents is important. They come in a vast range of
        shapes and sizes from the petite to the grand. Cacti and succulents fall
        into the same group because they both have characteristics meaning they
        can survive in arid environments.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The native habitat for most cacti and succulents is a desert. Therefore,
        they will grow best in lots of light, good drainage, high temperatures,
        and low moisture. However, there are some cacti and succulents, such as
        Schlumbergera, which have a native environment of a rainforest so prefer
        semi-shade and humid conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Caring for cacti and succulents means trying to recreate their natural
        habitat. Here are the main things that you need to consider when caring
        for your cacti and succulents.
      </p>
      <img class="img" src="assets/post/cacti.webp" alt="" />
      <h2>Light, temperature and ventilation</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Cacti and succulents thrive with good light sources, and it is best to
        place cacti and succulents in a bright place. A south facing position
        will provide good sunlight. However, be careful to not put them in
        direct sunlight because the intense light can make the plants turn a
        yellow colour. The optimum light depends on the variety of cacti and
        succulent that you are growing. For example, forest-growing epiphytes,
        such as Rhipsalis, need semi-shade, but an Echeveria needs bright light.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        During the autumn and winter months, it is best for the plants to be
        kept cool at night with temperatures of around 8°C to 10°C. In the
        spring and summer the plants need good ventilation, but will survive in
        high temperatures.
      </p>
      <h2>Compost</h2>
      <p class="text">
        A free-draining compost is a good compost to use as it has added girt
        and sand for optimum drainage. It also contains the right level of
        nutrients for your cacti and succulents.
      </p>
      <img class="img" src="assets/post/compost.webp" alt="" />
      <h2>Watering and feeding</h2>
      <p class="text">
        There is a common misconception that cacti and succulents only require a
        small amount of water. Even though they have water-storing
        characteristics in their leaves and stems which allow them to survive in
        dry habitats, they will certainly not thrive with little water. Watering
        is an essential part to how well your cacti or succulent grows.
        Overwatering will stunt growth, but under-watering causes shrivelling.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Tepid rainwater should be used for watering, rather than tap water. This
        is because the minerals in tap water build up in the soil and can cause
        deposits on the leaves. Minerals also disrupt the flow of essential
        nutrients to the plant.
      </p>
      <img class="img" src="assets/post/watering.webp" alt="" />
      <h2>Spring and summer</h2>
      <p class="text">
        In the growing season, the plants should be watered at least once a
        week. When watering, the soil should be given a good soaking, allowing
        excess water to drain away. Allow the compost to dry out slightly
        between each watering.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Feed your plants once a month using special cacti and succulent feed. It
        helps them to produce healthy growth with more disease tolerance and
        better flowering. Simply use the dosing chamber to get a 5ml dose of the
        feed and add to 1 litre of water.
      </p>
      <h2>Autumn and winter</h2>
      <p class="text">
        This is the time where the plants enter a rest period. Watering should
        be reduced so that the potting mix dries out between the watering. The
        regularity of watering is dependent on the environment they are in and
        the variety of succulent. Winter-flowering cacti needs to be in the
        warmth and have regular watering at this time, but desert-dwellers can
        be left un-watered. You do not need to feed cacti or succulents during
        this period.
      </p>
      <h2>Re-potting</h2>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          Firstly water the plant and allow to drain before removing carefully
          from the pot, using folded paper to protect your hands against the
          spikes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clear away the old soil from the roots with a thin stick, such as a
          chopstick, so that you do not damage the roots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put a layer of potting mix in the new pot, which is slightly bigger in
          diameter, and sit the plant on it.
        </li>
        <li>Fill the rest of the pot with the potting mix and firm down.</li>
        <li>
          Do not water for a few days to prevent rotting of damaged roots.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">
        Keeping these conditions gives the best care for your cacti or
        succulent. Most importantly, remember when it comes to the caring for
        your plant is that you are trying to recreate its natural habitat!
